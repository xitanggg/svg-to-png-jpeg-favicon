Hi thereüëã This is a free online tool that allows you to convert `SVG` files to `PNG`, `JPEG`, `ICO` (Favicon) images.

It is very simple and fast - it runs only in your browser and allows you to customize image width and heightüí® Try it out here: [https://svg-to-png-jpeg-favicon.vercel.app](https://svg-to-png-jpeg-favicon.vercel.app)

## üí° Story

While trying to do some svg to images conversion, I couldn't find any simple online tool that allows me to do soü§Ø This was frustrating since the latest `Web APIs` - [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) have made it very easy to convert files to different image types on a modern browser. So I went ahead and coded out this simple tool myself and shared it out there with others who might also experience the frustrationüî•

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

This tool is open-source - you can use it for anything and read about its full implementation in `/pages/index.tsx`. The core utility is the `Canvas Class`, which is only ~100 lines of JavaScript code. At high level, it uses the below [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction) to perform the svg conversion:

1. [URL.createObjectURL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL) to read the svg file and convert it to a DOMString
2. [CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawImage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage) to render a svg image on a canvas without losing resolution
3. [HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL) to convert the svg file on canvas to be different image types based on user selection - `.png` `.jpeg` `.ico`

Since Web APIs are bundled into a browser, you can run this tool entirely offline on any modern day browser.
